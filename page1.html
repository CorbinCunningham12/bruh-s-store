            One might be in the market for off the radar, under the table, illegal, and quite an amazing asortment of steals on radioactive explosives. I sure found myself that way until this nice gentlemen greeted me in an alleyway in Sao Paulo. His offer was quite amazing, I can recall his words exactly. 'Tell no one and hand over the money I have to hurry before they find me.' Quite and odd fellow but very nice nonetheless.

            After purchasing the bombs I set up shop in a nice shack in london. Didn't last long because it attracted a lot of police. Bah, it was as every passerby reported a bomb threat every other teusday. Preposterous. Anyway, I finally found a location for me and my shop. La Havana, Cuba. I do beleive it was quite peacfull until the United States mistook my products for russion nuclear warheads. And finally I decided to take my shop online, and bruh's store was reborn on the internet. with a total of half a dozen sales to some global superpowers, i'd say business is pretty good!
