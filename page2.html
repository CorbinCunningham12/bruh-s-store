            Please my goal is only to spread absolute happiness with my customers. I'd say i'm doing pretty well so far too! Many global superpowers were ecstatic with my low and respectable prices and deals. One even gasped with glee and bought out most of my stock! It took some time but I fully replenished my selection and was back to selling only the finest nuclear weapons I have to offer!
